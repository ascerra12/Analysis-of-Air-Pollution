Analysis of Air Pollution

Data was taken from 332 different location. Using R this project answers important questions that involve looking through all data points.

Under the src folder you will find the code that answer these following 20 questions (Question number 16 is excluded).

1.	For each location calculate simple statistics for Sulfate and Nitrate: Min, 1st quartile, Median, Mean, 3rd quartile, Max. (You can write your own function or use an existed R method/s.)
2.	Find a location with smallest mean value for Sulfate concentration. Find location with largest mean value for Sulfate concentration. Find location with average mean value of Sulfate concentration.
3.	Visualize calculated simple statistics values of Sulfate concentration for the 3 locations found in Question 2.
4.	Find a location with smallest mean value for Nitrate concentration. Find location with largest mean value for Nitrate concentration. Find location with average mean value of Nitrate concentration.
5.	Visualize calculated simple statistics values of Nitrate concentration for the 3 locations found in Question 4.
6.	Visualize a relationship between mean values of Sulfate and Nitrate concentrations over the locations.  Is there any interesting relationship between Sulfate and Nitrate mean concentrations? Explain your answer.
7.	Find a correlation vector of Max value of Sulfate and Max value of Nitrate concentrations over all locations.
8.	Find a correlation vector of Min value of Sulfate and Min value of Nitrate concentrations over all locations.
9.	Find a correlation vector of Mean value of Sulfate and Mean value of Nitrate concentrations over all locations.
10.	Calculate a correlation between vectors from Question 7 and 9.
11.	Calculate a correlation between vectors from Question 8 and 9.
12.	Construct a linear regression model for Sulfate and Nitrate concentration relationship for the location with highest Sulfate concentration. Graph it. Find residuals, coefficients, basic accuracy measures.
13.	Construct a linear regression model for Sulfate and Nitrate concentration relationship for the location with lowest Sulfate concentration. Graph it. Find residuals, coefficients, basic accuracy measures.
14.	Construct a linear regression model for Sulfate and Nitrate concentration relationship for the location with highest Nitrate concentration. Graph it. Find residuals, coefficients, basic accuracy measures.
15.	Construct a linear regression model for Sulfate and Nitrate concentration relationship for the location with lowest Nitrate concentration. Graph it. Find residuals, coefficients, basic accuracy measures.
16.	Which of the models (in Question 7 - 10) fits best the linear regression model. Explain your answer.
17.	Find confident interval for Sulfate concentration values for the location with highest Sulfate concentration.
18.	Find confident interval for Sulfate concentration values for the location with lowest Sulfate concentration.
19.	Find confident interval for Nitrate concentration values for the location with highest Sulfate concentration.
20.	Find confident interval for Nitrate concentration values for the location with lowest Sulfate concentration.
